# Information Systems Development Project 

## Objectives of the Project 
The objectives of this project is to improve the processes that are currently implemented at the majore travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). The information gathered through reading the document specification of the travel company  has highlighted the changes that our customers would like to see integrated into the new Information System (IS). It is understood that the current model is outdated and needs to be more streamlined in order to achieve maximum efficiecny and effectivness. 

## Design thinking approach 

### Problem definition 

Currently, Relationship managers communicate with customers through the in-house call management centre. The current operating system inefficiently directs inbound and outbound customers to relationship managers, resulting in lost customers, due to long waiting periods and ill informed services, which further leads to loss of sales and loss of repeat customers  

To reduce these inefficiencies, the information system should integrate improved call routing and dynamic flow control to better suit relationship managers to their customers and reduce the waiting period of potential buyers. 

### Stakeholders 

Our key stakeholders for this new operating system include: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

### Point of View Statements

The following are the key Point of View (POV) statements which were identified through analysing the project specification and the empathy maps. 

| POV Statment Number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| POV #1| A customer should be connected with the best suited relationship manager that has knowledge and experience with their holiday pakcage of interest. The more reliable the information and detail the relationship manager can provide will lead to improved customer relationships and increase likelihood of a sale purchase|
| POV #2| A relationship manager needs a way to make outbound calls and receive inbound calls, whilst also delivering efficient and well-informed conversations about potential holiday packages. They need to be matched with callers that are express interest in their field of experience so that they provide reliable information to the customer |
| POV #3| A customer who is interested in holiday package needs a way to communicate efficiently with a well-informed relationship manager on the holiday package that interest them the most because this will help in their decision to purchase a package.|

The POV statements served as tool to optimize the work process, to benefit the companys understanding of end users and to launch our brainstorm of How Might We (HMW) statements, which is featured below.

### How Might We Statements 

The following table shows all of the How Might We Statements (HMW) built from the POV statements. 

|HMW Number | How Might We... | 
| --- | --- |
| HMW #1 | reduce the time that the customer do need to hang up  |
| HMW #2 | improve the relationship between staffs and customers  |
| HMW #3 | improve the quality in the conversation betweem customers and RMs  |
| HMW #4 | understand which products that customers want to know about  |
| HMW #5 |enable the relationship manager to make outbound calls   |
| HMW #6 | enable the relationship manager to make and receive well informed conversations with potential buyers  |
| HMW #7 | increase the amount of calls completed by the relationship manager  |
| HMW #8 | decrease the waiting period between each inbound customer  |
| HMW #9 | speed up the time the relationship manager spends with its clients |
| HMW #10 | assist the relationship manager in developing genuine relationships between customers and business |
| HMW #11 | assist the customer in communicating their interests  |
| HMW #12 | provide a suitable relationship manager to customers |
| HMW #13 | increase the time taken to make a purchase with a customer |
| HMW #14|  identify which customers previously used the service before |
| HMW #15 | improve the staff skill so they can serve the new customer with the best they can |
| HMW #16 | match the RM with the buyer that they have talked before |
| HMW #17 | receive the feedback from the customer that can improve the quality of the service| 

### Reflection

At this stage of the project, we have as a team, empathised with our key stakeholders, and defined the gaps in the current operating system, to which solutions will be provided in upcoming work products.  We have generated empathy maps for each of our key stakeholders: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

These stakeholders will be most affected by the implementation of the new system. We have analysed their thoughts and behaviours, as well their key pains and gains. We brainstormed Point of View (POV) Statements and converted them into How Might We (HMW) Statements to reframe our insights in relation to the best solution for the new information system. 

Moving forward, we will use the product backlog generated from these brainstorming exercises to kickstart our progression into the ideation phase. During this stage, we will develop work products such as use case diagrams and activity diagrams to generate a systematic solution for the operating system. 

One of the biggest challenges so far is understanding the scope of the project and how extensive the improvement in the information system will be for the travel company. Whether or not the  new operating system will extend to customers having access to the system online is still a consideration we are yet to take onboard. 

Currently, our assumptions are based on our initial readings of the project outline. This is what we assume about the existing and new system, however, these are subject to change and/or  are expected to be resolved later in the project.
- The relationship manager can create a customer profile using the profiler tool. 
- Relationship managers can edit their profile
- relationship managers can make a purchase on behalf of the customer 
- achieiving a sale involves a purchase by the customer
- new customers will be automatically be allocated low priority 
- we have enough human resources to complete the work during a short time period
- do not have any dificulties during the working process

### Ideation 

Once we completed the key brainstorming exercises i.e. empathy map, POV statements and HMW statements, we used this understanding of the end user to formulate user stories. The further brainstorming of user stories, formed the product backlog for our project. Eventually, these user stories were incoporated into work products.

#### Product Backlog/ User Stories 


| User Story Number  | User Story | Priority |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| US #1 | As a relationship manager, i want my special discounts rates to be displayed to me so that i can offer my clients competitive rates  | Low | 
| US #2 | As a relationship manager, i want to record any sales made, so that i can improve my skill score | High | 
| US #3 | As a relationship manager, i want to be able to input customers payment details on there behalf, so that i can make a payment for a holiday package | High | 
| US #4 | As a relationship manager, i want to be able to create, edit and delete my profile, so that i can keep customers updated on my skill, experiences and knowledge.  | High | 
| US #5 | As a relationship manager, i want to retrieve the target list, so that i can make calls to outbound customers | High | 
| US #6 | As a relationship manager, i want to view customers details and potential holiday packages, so that i can deliver a more specific and tailored service  | High | 
| US #7 | As a relationship manager, i want to servce customers with the highest scores, so that i can achieve a sale efficiently  | High | 
| US #8 | As an inbound customer, i want to view the prices of holiday packages in order of lowest to highest fares, so that i can choose the holiday packages efficiently.| Low | 
| US #9 | As an inbound customer, i want to connect to the RMs that serve me before so that i can work with them easily | Medium | 
| US #10 | As an inbound customer, i want to be directed to a relationship manager who is familliar with a particular holiday package, so that i can obtain reliable information about the place | Medium | 
| US #11 | As an inbound customer, i want to view different holiday packages, so that i can develop more information about each place  |Low | 
| US #12 | As a an inbound customer, i want to view the purchases made through the travel company, so i can review the holiday packages  | Medium |
| US #13 | As an outbound customer, i want to see the feedback about the company before i made the purchase so that i can believe that i will not be scammed  | Medium |
| US #14 | As Travel company, i want to save the customer's feedbacks so that we can improve the negative aspects of the company | Medium |
| US #15 | As the Call Management Centre, i want to direct customers to an Interactive Voice Response when no relationship manager is available, so that we can gather feedback and information from the customer  | High |
| US #16 | As the Call Management Centre, i want to be able to create, view and delete customer and relationship manager profiles, so that i keep information about end users updated | High |
| US #17 | As the Call Management Centre, i want generate scores for relationship managers and customers, so that they can be matched based off this criteria | Medium |

All these user stories formed the foundation of our solution to a new and improved Information System (IS) for the travel company. In the following sections, we explore the detailed models and descriptions of the IS process. 

## Prototyping and models - Workproducts, models and descriptions

After identifying the key user stories, we integrated these use stories as use cases into our work products. The following diagrams are illustrated below: 
- Use Case Diagram 
- Class Diagram 
- Activity Diagram 
- Collaborative Diagram 

### Use case Diagrams

At the beginning of the project, we developed an intial use case diagram. However, after deliberation and constant review of the diagram and use cases, we developed a more in-depth model of the interactions between users and the system, as seen in the second iteration. 

For the second iteration, we decided to split the customer into Inbound Customers and Outbound Customers. This provided a clearer representation of the interactions that occur between the actors and their use cases.

### Activity Diagrams

Similarly, with the development of the activity diagram, we began with initial activity diagram, which then were later expanded to include greater depth on the systems interactions and functionality.

## Scrum activities 

For this project, we used the Scrum development process to help facilitate teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress towards our defined goal for the new Information System. We used Git Hub as it seamlessly integrates transparency throughout the development of the project, as each team member was able to openly view, edit and provide feedback on each commit to the repository. 

To begin with, we used user stories to develop our product backlog, as well as any arbitrary tasks which needed to be completed prior to that. For our first sprint, we generated a backlog, which contained the most important user stories, as that would form the foundations of our work products. These were labelled as ‘Important’ in the ‘Issues’ section of Git Hub. For example some user stories which were selected from the Product backlog for the initial sprint related to creating an existing customer profile and a corresponding RM profile. We used a Kanban board to help visualise and manage the issues which needed to be integrated in the sprint. We divided the board into ‘To do”, “In progress” and “Done”. Once a user story has been fully accounted for, only then was it allowed to be added to “Done”. This procedure was supportive of continuous delivery, enabling work products to be released and completed frequently to the Git Hub repository. 

In relation to Scrum events implemented into the project, we took the basic format of many of the scrum meetings and tailored it to the context of this assignment (i.e. student commitments, the project didn’t require code development and inability for face to face communication). As a result, Scrum meetings were conducted primarily during tutorials and were instigated simultaneously during the class. During weekly tutorials we completed sprint planning meetings which consisted of the following: 
-	We discussed the tasks that were completed in the prior week and tasks that need to be completed for the next week. 
-	We conducted sprint review meetings by analysing the backlog not completed in the prior sprint and adding these features into our next sprint.  
-	We conducted sprint review retrospective meeting by reviewing processes that worked well, what created the most problems and discussed solutions rectify problems for future sprints. 

Throughout the week we maintained constant communication via social media platforms, emails, and weekly zoom calls (outside of class hours). This allowed for open and honest communication between team members, which ensured greater transparency in the project. 


## Competitive advantages and possible effects if the project fails 

The prospective/proposed call management system has the potential to contribute significantly to the economic situation of the beneficiary company. The company’s success hinges on its employees’ ability to interface meaningfully and appropriately with potential/existing customers in order to facilitate the purchase of holiday packages. In the current operational blueprint, this interfacing is relatively unregulated, and unoptimised, that is, relationship managers are independently responsible for the type of customers they communicate with and the nature of that communication. The proposed system, as outlined, would manage the pairing of customers and relationship managers based on both survey results and demographic profiling, a system which offers the company clear competitive advantages. As customer target lists are generated and optimally allocated, relationship managers have more time to dedicate to the actual sale which directly links to economic improvement, further, they can be confident that their technique is suited to their candidates, both of which would contribute to relationship manager satisfaction and confidence. Call centers with low employee satisfaction are more conducive for stress and then more likely to have high employee turnover rates, this is corrosive of relationship managers’ abilities to form customer connections and relationships and to develop their own skill base. From the customer’s perspective, firstly: a satisfied and confident relationship manager is less likely to communicate unnecessary or irrelevant information, further, customers want to feel like their RM understands their requirements, which would be assured through the survey and the behaviour of their assigned RM. A more structured, efficient approach to customer interfacing would reduce time, power and skill wastage, and improve customer satisfaction and therefore the likelihood customers will both complete the booking process and return in the future, both with obvious fiscal advantages. If this system implementation fails, the company will have spent time and resources training employees and enabling baseline compatibility for a system they will not reap the benefits of. This could lead to a decrease in employee satisfaction and a resultant decrease in successful customer interactions. The competitive advantages that this system offers the call management company include: increased time for productive work, increased employee and customer satisfaction and facilitate more fruitful relationships between customers and employees, and, while the company is opened up to risks as a consequence of the system’s potential failure, the advantages should outweigh the risks. Simplistically, The system has the potential to significantly improve economic output, which should be enough to convince the company to implement this system.
