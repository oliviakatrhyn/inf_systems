# Information Systems Development Project 

## Objectives of the Project 
The objectives of this project is to improve the processes that are currently implemented at the majore travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). The information gathered through reading the document specification of the travel company  has highlighted the changes that our customers would like to see integrated into the new Information System (IS). It is understood that the current model is outdated and needs to be more streamlined in order to achieve maximum efficiecny and effectivness. 

## Design thinking approach 

### Problem definition 

Currently, Relationship managers communicate with customers through the in-house call management centre. The current operating system inefficiently directs inbound and outbound customers to relationship managers, resulting in lost customers, due to long waiting periods and ill informed services, which further leads to loss of sales and loss of repeat customers  

To reduce these inefficiencies, the information system should integrate improved call routing and dynamic flow control to better suit relationship managers to their customers and reduce the waiting period of potential buyers. Moreover, a supporting tool for creating customer profiles should exist, as well as as profiling tool for Relationship managers that stores there age, gender, culture, language level, experience and product knowledge.

### Stakeholders 

Our key stakeholders for this new operating system include: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

### Point of View Statements

The following are the key Point of View (POV) statements which were identified through analysing the project specification and the empathy maps. 

| POV Statment Number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| POV #1| A customer should be connected with the best suited relationship manager that has knowledge and experience with their holiday pakcage of interest. The more reliable the information and detail the relationship manager can provide will lead to improved customer relationships and increase likelihood of a sale purchase|
| POV #2| A relationship manager needs a way to make outbound calls and receive inbound calls, whilst also delivering efficient and well-informed conversations about potential holiday packages. They need to be matched with callers that are express interest in their field of experience so that they provide reliable information to the customer |
| POV #3| A customer who is interested in holiday package needs a way to communicate efficiently with a well-informed relationship manager on the holiday package that interest them the most because this will help in their decision to purchase a package.|

The POV statements served as tool to optimize the work process, to benefit the companys understanding of end users and to launch our brainstorm of How Might We (HMW) statements, which is featured below.

### How Might We Statements 

The following table shows all of the How Might We Statements (HMW) built from the POV statements. 

|HMW Number | How Might We... | 
| --- | --- |
| HMW #1 | reduce the time that the customer do need to hang up  |
| HMW #2 | improve the relationship between staffs and customers  |
| HMW #3 | improve the quality in the conversation betweem customers and RMs  |
| HMW #4 | understand which products that customers want to know about  |
| HMW #5 |enable the relationship manager to make outbound calls   |
| HMW #6 | enable the relationship manager to make and receive well informed conversations with potential buyers  |
| HMW #7 | increase the amount of calls completed by the relationship manager  |
| HMW #8 | decrease the waiting period between each inbound customer  |
| HMW #9 | speed up the time the relationship manager spends with its clients |
| HMW #10 | assist the relationship manager in developing genuine relationships between customers and business |
| HMW #11 | assist the customer in communicating their interests  |
| HMW #12 | provide a suitable relationship manager to customers |
| HMW #13 | increase the time taken to make a purchase with a customer |
| HMW #14|  identify which customers previously used the service before |
| HMW #15 | improve the staff skill so they can serve the new customer with the best they can |
| HMW #16 | match the RM with the buyer that they have talked before |
| HMW #17 | receive the feedback from the customer that can improve the quality of the service| 

### Reflection

At this stage of the project, we have as a team, empathised with our key stakeholders, and defined the gaps in the current operating system, to which solutions will be provided in upcoming work products.  We have generated empathy maps for each of our key stakeholders: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

These stakeholders will be most affected by the implementation of the new system. We have analysed their thoughts and behaviours, as well their key pains and gains. We brainstormed Point of View (POV) Statements and converted them into How Might We (HMW) Statements to reframe our insights in relation to the best solution for the new information system. 

Moving forward, we will use the product backlog generated from these brainstorming exercises to kickstart our progression into the ideation phase. During this stage, we will develop work products such as use case diagrams and activity diagrams to generate a systematic solution for the operating system. 

One of the biggest challenges so far is understanding the scope of the project and how extensive the improvement in the information system will be for the travel company. Whether or not the  new operating system will extend to customers having access to the system online is still a consideration we are yet to take onboard. 

Currently, our assumptions are based on our initial readings of the project outline. This is what we assume about the existing and new system, however, these are subject to change and/or  are expected to be resolved later in the project.
- The relationship manager can create a customer profile using the profiler tool. 
- Relationship managers can edit their profile
- relationship managers can make a purchase on behalf of the customer 
- achieiving a sale involves a purchase by the customer
- new customers will be automatically be allocated low priority 
- we have enough human resources to complete the work during a short time period
- do not have any dificulties during the working process

### Ideation 

Once we completed the key brainstorming exercises i.e. empathy map, POV statements and HMW statements, we used this understanding of the end user to formulate user stories. The further brainstorming of user stories, formed the product backlog for our project. Eventually, these user stories were incoporated into work products.

#### Product Backlog/ User Stories 


| User Story Number  | User Story | Priority |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| US #1 | As a relationship manager, i want my special discounts rates to be displayed to me so that i can offer my clients competitive rates  | Low | 
| US #2 | As a relationship manager, i want to record any sales made, so that i can improve my skill score | High | 
| US #3 | As a relationship manager, i want to be able to input customers payment details on there behalf, so that i can make a payment for a holiday package | High | 
| US #4 | As a relationship manager, i want to be able to create, edit and delete my profile, so that i can keep customers updated on my skill, experiences and knowledge.  | High | 
| US #5 | As a relationship manager, i want to retrieve the target list, so that i can make calls to outbound customers | High | 
| US #6 | As a relationship manager, i want to view customers details and potential holiday packages, so that i can deliver a more specific and tailored service  | High | 
| US #7 | As a relationship manager, i want to servce customers with the highest scores, so that i can achieve a sale efficiently  | High | 
| US #8 | As an inbound customer, i want to view the prices of holiday packages in order of lowest to highest fares, so that i can choose the holiday packages efficiently.| Low | 
| US #9 | As an inbound customer, i want to connect to the RMs that serve me before so that i can work with them easily | Medium | 
| US #10 | As an inbound customer, i want to be directed to a relationship manager who is familliar with a particular holiday package, so that i can obtain reliable information about the place | Medium | 
| US #11 | As an inbound customer, i want to view different holiday packages, so that i can develop more information about each place  |Low | 
| US #12 | As a an inbound customer, i want to view the purchases made through the travel company, so i can review the holiday packages  | Medium |
| US #13 | As an outbound customer, i want to see the feedback about the company before i made the purchase so that i can believe that i will not be scammed  | Medium |
| US #14 | As Travel company, i want to save the customer's feedbacks so that we can improve the negative aspects of the company | Medium |
| US #15 | As the Call Management Centre, i want to direct customers to an Interactive Voice Response when no relationship manager is available, so that we can gather feedback and information from the customer  | High |
| US #16 | As the Call Management Centre, i want to be able to create, view and delete customer and relationship manager profiles, so that i keep information about end users updated | High |
| US #17 | As the Call Management Centre, i want generate scores for relationship managers and customers, so that they can be matched based off this criteria | Medium |

All these user stories formed the foundation of our solution to a new and improved Information System (IS) for the travel company. In the following sections, we explore the detailed models and descriptions of the IS process. 

## Prototyping and models - Workproducts, models and descriptions

After identifying the key user stories, we integrated these use stories as use cases into our work products. The following diagrams are illustrated below: 
- Use Case Diagram 
- Class Diagram 
- Activity Diagram 
- Collaborative Diagram 

### Use case Diagrams

***First Iteration***

At the beginning of the project, we developed an intial use case diagram, as seen below. However, after deliberation and constant review of the diagram and use cases, we developed a more in-depth model of the interactions between users and the system, as seen in the second iteration. 

<p align="center">

</p>

***Second Iteration***

For the second iteration, we decided to split the customer into Inbound Customers and Outbound Customers. This provided a clearer representation of the interactions that occur between the actors and their use cases. 

*For Inbound Customers:*

## Scrum activities 
*Explanation and outline of Scrum activities used

By concentrating on orchestration and management of agile software programs, Scrum contrasts with the technical emphasis of intense programming. The activities of SCRUM can be summarized as follows:
- A group called sprints work on short cycles, estimated time in 3 weeks.
- There is a product backlog list, which prioritizes other features or outputs or project requirements list.
- Sprint Planning: Some features will be selected from the Product backlog before each sprint. The feature selected here is to create an existing customer profile and a corresponding RM profile may depend on age, gender, culture, language level, experience, and product knowledge. This feature was chosen because there were enough human resources and they believed it could be done in 3 weeks' work.
- Daily Scrum: The team will meet daily for about 15 minutes to update the progress of the work as well as share the difficulties encountered during software development. The work will continue if no problems occur.
- Sprint Review: The work will be reviewed to complete by the product owner and development group to change or modify the products during the Sprint.
- The team then reviews the Sprint and reflects on what they have learned and what they can improve for the next cycle.

For this project, we used the Scrum development process to help facilitate teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress towards our defined goal for the new Information System. We used Git Hub as it seamlessly integrates transparency throughout the development of the project, as each team member was able to openly view, edit and provide feedback on each commit to the repository. 

To begin with, we used user stories to develop our product backlog, as well as any arbitrary tasks which needed to be completed prior to that. For our first sprint, we generated a backlog, which contained the most important user stories, as that would form the foundations of our work products. These were labelled as ‘Important’ in the ‘Issues’ section of Git Hub. For example some user stories which were selected from the Product backlog for the initial sprint related to creating an existing customer profile and a corresponding RM profile. We used a Kanban board to help visualise and manage the issues which needed to be integrated in the sprint. We divided the board into ‘To do”, “In progress” and “Done”. Once a user story has been fully accounted for, only then was it allowed to be added to “Done”. This procedure was supportive of continuous delivery, enabling work products to be released and completed frequently to the Git Hub repository. 

In relation to Scrum events implemented into the project, we took the basic format of many of the scrum meetings and tailored it to the context of this assignment (i.e. student commitments, the project didn’t require code development and inability for face to face communication). As a result, Scrum meetings were conducted primarily during tutorials and were instigated simultaneously during the class. During weekly tutorials we completed sprint planning meetings which consisted of the following: 
-	We discussed the tasks that were completed in the prior week and tasks that need to be completed for the next week. 
-	We conducted sprint review meetings by analysing the backlog not completed in the prior sprint and adding these features into our next sprint.  
-	We conducted sprint review retrospective meeting by reviewing processes that worked well, what created the most problems and discussed solutions rectify problems for future sprints. 

Throughout the week we maintained constant communication via social media platforms, emails, and weekly zoom calls (outside of class hours). This allowed for open and honest communication between team members, which ensured greater transparency in the project. Together, we completed iterations of our work products and continuously reviewed and edited user stories and assumptions. 


## Competitive advantages and possible effects if the project fails 

*E.g. Potential benefits to the call center (in terms of reducing cost and being able to carry out more effective calls). (Around 500 words)

Failure in projects will occur in any organization or project. There are countless explanations for failure. Often a project manager and/or team members are out of sight, the failure may be verified. Moreover, some issues have in common failing projects and people involved in failure.
By developing a new information system, the following competitive advantages can be achieved: Save time because the system will automatically dial for RMs according to the customer target list created by the system. In particular, it will reach potential customers in-depth, meet the needs of customers, and bring greater revenue.
Some of the best ways to reduce costs and increasing the level of customer service is to ensure the necessary knowledge, training and tools are available for the agents to react appropriately to customer needs. This can be achieved by hiring agents who are ideally qualified, who train them to succeed and provide regular performance reviews and coaching. A team of great call centers will help improve first call resolution, reduce time and improve the customer service quality.
Create the requirements for customers and take their contact details before going any further. It means that staff can track the questionnaire. When the customer wants a specific service or product which you do not sell, then open up the discussion and learn more.
If the system fails, the business will have to spend a lot of money and time to invest in this project. Moreover, the way of operation is not improved can lead to a reduction in the number of potential customers, thereby reducing the company's revenue and profit. Lower customer's satisfaction is one of the reason that could contribute to reduce the number of customer. And staffs that experience significant workplace stress are less effective, knowledgeable, and productive. Call centers that are more conductive to stress have higher agent turnover rates for agents. Therefore, the staff could be work less effectively which cause to affect the customer services
