# Information Systems Development Project 

## Objectives of the Project 
The objectives of this project is to improve the processes that are currently implemented at the majore travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). The information gathered through reading the document specification of the travel company  has highlighted the changes that our customers would like to see integrated into the new Information System (IS). It is understood that the current model is outdated and needs to be more streamlined in order to achieve maximum efficiecny and effectivness. Moreover, a supporting tool for creating customer profiles that exist that corresponds to the RM profile may depend on age, gender, culture, language level, experience and product knowledge

## Design thinking approach 

### Problem definition 

Currently, Relationship managers communicate with customers through the in-house call management centre. The current operating system inefficiently directs inbound and outbound customers to relationship managers, resulting in lost customers, due to long waiting periods and ill informed services, which further leads to loss of sales and loss of repeat customers  

To reduce these inefficiencies, the information system should integrate improved call routing and dynamic flow control to better suit relationship managers to their customers and reduce the waiting period of potential buyers. 

### Stakeholders 

Our key stakeholders for this new operating system include: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

### Point of View Statements

| POV Statment Number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| POV #1 | An inbound customers needs to be able to hang up when call holds up become too long because customers will not have the opportunity to wait extended period of time
| POV #2 | A customer should be coordinated with the best possible RM because this will greatly improve the likelihood of sales and customers will be provided with better suited products |
| POV #3| A relationship manager needs a way to make outbound calls and receive inbound calls, whilst also delivering efficient and well-informed conversations about potential holiday packages. They need to be able to provide genuine conversation about holiday packages that might interest the caller to efficiently and effectively achieve a sale. |
| POV #4| A customer who is interested in holiday package needs a way to communicate efficiently with a well-informed relationship manager on the holiday package that interest them the most because this will help in their decision to purchase a package.|
| POV #5| Company should divide the customer into 2 types which are new customer and old customer. And then the customer that have used the service before should be matched with the RM that served them before so it will have the good results and there will have a good feedback from the customer. |

### Reflection

At this stage of the project, we have as a team, empathised with our key stakeholders, and defined the gaps in the current operating system, to which solutions will be provided in upcoming work products.  We have generated empathy maps for each of our key stakeholders: 

-	Inbound customer callers
-	Outbound customer callers
-	Relationship manager (RM) 
-	Call Management Centre (CMC)

These stakeholders will be most affected by the implementation of the new system. We have analysed their thoughts and behaviours, as well their key pains and gains. We brainstormed Point of View (POV) Statements and converted them into How Might We (HMW) Statements to reframe our insights in relation to the best solution for the new information system. 

Moving forward, we will use the product backlog generated from these brainstorming exercises to kickstart our progression into the ideation phase. During this stage, we will develop work products such as use case diagrams and activity diagrams to generate a systematic solution for the operating system. 

One of the biggest challenges so far is understanding the scope of the project and how extensive the improvement in the information system will be for the travel company. Whether or not the  new operating system will extend to customers having access to the system online is still a consideration we are yet to take onboard. 

Currently, our assumptions are based on our initial readings of the project outline. This is what we assume about the existing and new system, however, these are subject to change and/or  are expected to be resolved later in the project.
- The relationship manager can create a customer profile using the profiler tool. 
- Relationship managers can edit their profile
- relationship managers can make a purchase on behalf of the customer 
- achieiving a sale involves a purchase by the customer
- new customers will be automatically be allocated low priority 
- we have enough human resources to complete the work during a short time period
- do not have any dificulties during the working process
